# Probability-of-Overlap-BHs-SNRs
Probability of Overlap code used in Balakrishnan et al. 2023.

BH catalog: https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016A%26A...587A..61C/abstract
SNR catalog: https://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/

Here, I have included the .csv files that I read into the .ipynb file. The .csv files are in weird formats, this is just how I managed to format the data from the above catalogs.

In the .ipynb file, I explain how we use these catalogs to simulate Milky Way-like galaxies and count the number of overlaps between BHs and SNRs.
